# 42 Cursus Projects

Welcome to my 42 Cursus Projects repository! Here, I document my journey through the 42 school curriculum, tackling a range of programming and computer science projects designed to build technical skills, creativity, and resilience.

## About 42

The **42 School** is an innovative, tuition-free coding school that focuses on peer-to-peer learning and project-based education. The curriculum is rigorous and collaborative, pushing students to solve complex problems and learn independently.

## Projects

This repository contains a collection of my projects from the 42 curriculum. Each project showcases a unique set of skills and principles, from low-level programming and algorithmic thinking to system administration and web development.
