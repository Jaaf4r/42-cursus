1-	fd parameter less than 0 || buffer_size less than or equals 0 == NULL
2-	malloc buffer with buffer_size + 1
3-	loop through a line of a certain file
4-	inside the loop, IF the read() func return (aka. bytes_read) is  0 or -1, we return (NULL).
	ELSE, if (bytes_read < buffer_size), we should '\0' the buffer[bytes_read]
		  if there is a '\n' in the buffer, we break from the loop ad return the line that was read (str);
5-	




for example:
buffer size = 10000000
read() return = 22
